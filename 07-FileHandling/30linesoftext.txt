The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
All that glitters is not gold.
Actions speak louder than words.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Cry over spilled milk.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Fortune favors the bold.
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.
Haste makes waste.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
Jump on the bandwagon.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Make hay while the sun shines.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Practice makes perfect.
Quality over quantity.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Silence is golden.
The early bird catches the worm.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
Under the weather.
Variety is the spice of life.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Zeal without knowledge is a runaway horse.
