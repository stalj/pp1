You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
And dust yourself off
And back in the saddle
You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We are getting closer
This isn't over
The pressure is on
You feel it
But you got it all
Believe it
When you fall,
Get up oh, oh
If you fall,
Get up eh, eh
Tsa mina mina zangalewa
Cause this is Africa
Tza mina mina eh eh
Waka waka eh eh
Tsa mina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
Listen to your God
This is our motto
Your time to shine
Don't wait in line
Y vamos por todo
People are raising
Their expectations
Go on and feed them
This is your moment
No hesitations
Today's your day,
I feel it
You paved the way,
Believe it
If you get down
Get up oh, oh
When you get down
Get up eh, eh
Tsa mina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
Tza mina mina eh eh
Waka waka eh eh
Tsa mina mina zangalewa
Anawa aa aa
Tsa mina mina eh eh
Waka waka eh eh
Tsa mina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
